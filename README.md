This SteamLit webapp is backended by a Pinecone index referencing ClimateNow videos transcripts.
It gives to the users the possiblity to run semantic search on these videos transcripts.

For each query proceeded, the Q&A engine returns elements of answering and the url links pointing to
the exact moment of the videos when query answers are discussed.
